Parsing Testing:
If there are less than 6 rooms in the file the last room read will duplicate until a total of 6 rooms
If there are more than 6 rooms in a file the excess rooms are ignored
If an object is invalid, as in the first character is there but one or both location values are missing, the missing values will default to 0
If the door is placed outside of the wall it will be returned to said wall, harshly
If items have the same location value they will be stored and dealt with while drawing
If the hero apeares in any line other than the first one it will be ignored
If there is a random item in the file ie x2,2 it will be ignored
If there is a stray character in the file ie x it will cause a segfault
If there is a stray character with a comma ie x, it will be ignored
If there is no door on a room, a complemetary door will be provided
Items are random each time the program runs
Items spawn chances work effectively
Monsters, and Items will not cause go over memory because everything is allocated to the maximum possible (if the whole file is only said item)

Drawing Testing:
If two items are placed in the same location, the 2nd item will try to move to any open adjecent space, if it cant it will continue to overwrite the first item
If there are not enough doors/door pairs to ensure all rooms will be connected and accessible, a "master hallway" will be generated

Rooms always spawn within their designated areas
all items within rooms are properly adjusted to the random spawn factor
quickdraw succesfully redraws the entire board without lag
